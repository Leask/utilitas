## Code style

- All programming languages should adhere to a strict mode.
- For all code files, aim to keep line lengths under 80 characters. In some cases, lengths up to 120 characters are acceptable. Longer lines are allowed only if a clear justification is provided.
For all documentation files, line length limits are not required.
- Use spaces for indentation in all code files, tabs are not allowed.
- Use `4 spaces` per indentation level, inclouding in languages that typically use 2 spaces. For example, `.js` and `.ts` files.
- If you're working on an existing project rather than starting a new one, adhere to the project's existing code style. Please disregard the 4-space rule in such cases.
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all text files.
- User single quotes for strings unless double quotes are necessary.

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
